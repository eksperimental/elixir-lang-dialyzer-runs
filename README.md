# Daily dialyzer checks on Elixir source code

This repository runs a dialyzer check on the Elixir source code.

Reports can be found at https://github.com/michallepicki/elixir-lang-dialyzer-runs/actions . Click the last event, then `dialyze` on the left, then expand "Run dialyzer" step to see errors.

Right now the output is noisy. See https://github.com/michallepicki/elixir-lang-dialyzer-runs/issues/2 for improvement ideas.
